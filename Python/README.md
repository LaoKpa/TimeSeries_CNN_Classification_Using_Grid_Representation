# TimeSeries CNN Classification Using Grid Representation
This project aims to apply the CNN algorithm - which has achieved great results in image processing - by treating the time-series data as an image.
Grid-based representation algorithms are used to represent time-series data as images. 

Representation
----------------------
To represent the time series as image data, we partition the time series using the m x n grid structure.
[Grid representation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-018-1264-0) is a compression technique that transforms a time series into a matrix format, while maintaining the point distribution of the original time series.

In the following, a detailed algorithm for transforming time-series into the grid is presented with python code.
```
def ts2Matrix(self, ts):
    matrix = np.zeros((self.m, self.n))
    T = len(ts)

    height = 1.0/self.m  # cell's height of grid 
    width = T/self.n  # cell's width of grid

    for idx in range(T):
        i = int((1-ts[idx])/height)
        if i == self.m:
            i -= 1

        t = idx+1
        j = t/width
        if int(j) == round(j, 7):  # If the point is at the cell boundary
            j = int(j)-1
        else:
            j = int(j)

        matrix[i][j] += 1
    return matrix
```
