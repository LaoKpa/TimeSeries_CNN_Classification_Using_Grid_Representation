# TimeSeries CNN Classification Using Grid Representation
This project aims to apply the CNN algorithm - which has achieved great results in image processing - by treating the time-series data as an image.
Grid-based representation algorithms are used to represent time-series data as images. 

Normalization
----------------------
First, We normalize all time series before transform to avoid bias due to differences in data range. Min-Max normalization is applied so that the value of each time series is in the 0-1 range.

>X' = (X-Xmin)/(Xmax-Xmin)

```
def feature_scaling(ts):
    n = len(ts)
    maximum = max(ts)
    minimum = min(ts)

    normalized_ts = list.copy(ts)
    r = maximum-minimum
    for i in range(n):
        normalized_ts[i] = (ts[i]-minimum)/r

    return normalized_ts
```


Representation
----------------------
To represent the time series as image data, we partition the time series using the m x n grid structure.
[Grid representation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-018-1264-0) is a compression technique that transforms a time series into a matrix format, while maintaining the point distribution of the original time series.

In the following, a detailed algorithm for transforming time-series into the grid is presented with python code.
```
def ts2Matrix(self, ts):
    matrix = np.zeros((self.m, self.n))
    T = len(ts)

    height = 1.0/self.m  # cell's height of grid 
    width = T/self.n  # cell's width of grid

    for idx in range(T):
        i = int((1-ts[idx])/height)
        if i == self.m:
            i -= 1

        t = idx+1
        j = t/width
        if int(j) == round(j, 7):  # If the point is at the cell boundary
            j = int(j)-1
        else:
            j = int(j)

        matrix[i][j] += 1
    return matrix
```

if m=5, n=7

Grid representation of sample from CBF([UCR archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/)) dataset. The partition

Convolutional Neural Networks architecture
----------------------
#### Simple Convolutional Neural Networks architecture for grid representation
![simple cnn architecture](Python/assets/img/Simple_CNN_architecture.png)
CNN architecture for time-series classification. This architecture consists of 2 convolution, 2 pooling, and 2 fully-connected layers.
The reason for designing this architecture is to compare with the experimental results of [Hatami et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00886.pdf)(2018) in which the time series are transformed into images using *Recurrent Plot* and the CNN classification is performed.
